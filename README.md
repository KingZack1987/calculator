# Scientific Calculator
The Scientific Calculator app is a programme written in python with tkinter. The app provides various mathematical function. The programme utilize the function eval, as a result, the programme can take in a long equation inputted by the user.

## What I learn
* The project allows me to practice the fundamentals of python
* I learn the basic of tkinter and learn how to creat the simple GUI for my program
* I have understanded the pros and cons of eval(). I read much about the security issue of using eval() and I tried to elimite the problem in my code 

## What I can improve
After reviewing the project again, I think the code will be more clean if I used a object oriented programming style.
It will also help me to change my code much more easily if I use this method.
